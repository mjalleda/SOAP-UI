Project7_CompositeProject:
----------------------------  
This is very simple assignment. You might all know what is composite project. To divide work in between testers we use Composite project concept. IN my assignment, I used this and I could create a single XML file for each of my test case. Steps:  
1: First I configured Composite Project value to True.  
2: Iâ€™ve four operations in web service and also there are four tester in the team.  
3: I created a single operation for each tester. If you see the assignment, you will find testcase1 is on name of Tester1, test case 2 is on name of Tester2 and so on.
