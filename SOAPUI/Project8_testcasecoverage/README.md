Project8_testcasecoverage:
=========================  
Here, I created assignment for test case coverage. You will “how much tests are covered in persentile(%)” & you will see which elements are covered and not covered.  
I created total three test steps.  
1: TestRequest1_AllElementsVerification_FromSOAPEnvelopeVerification: In this test step, I verified complete response, since all elements are verified, you see that 100% of tests are covered for this step.  
2: TestRequest2_MultipleElementsCovered: In this test step, I verified multiple elements NOT complete response, since multiple elements are verified, you see 15/16 elects are covered and not all.  
3: TestRequest3_OnlyOneElementCovered: In this test step, I verified only one elements NOT complete response, since one element is verified, you see 1/16 elements are covered and not all. You see which elements are covered and which are NOT.
