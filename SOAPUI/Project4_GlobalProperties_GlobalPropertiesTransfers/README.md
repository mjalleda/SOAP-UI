Project4_GlobalProeprties_GlobalPropertiesTransfers
=======================================================  
I used some global properties in different projects. So, I wanted to show examples that global property can be accessed in any projects. 

**For ex:**
1:Below two variables are used in this project > testsuite1_GlobalProperties_UsingInDifferentProject_B. And they also used in different project “Project2_Properties_Requirements > TestSuite2.7_GlobalProperties_Using_InDifferntProject_A”.   
GlobalPropertyStep_variable1_ForMultipleProject  
GlobalPropertyStep_variable2_ForMultipleProject

2: I transferred global properties value in two different projects.   
One is in Project 3_Propertytransfers > TestSuite10_GlobalPropertyTransfer_InDifferentProject_A  
another one is this project > TestSuite2_GlobalProeprtiesTransfer_InDiffernetProject_B
