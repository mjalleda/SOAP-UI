Project11_MockServices:
=======================  
In this assignment,   
- I created MockServices using Web Service “CurrencyConverter”.   
- IN Mock Service, entered my result in response.   
- Then created test suite > test case > test step but didn’t pass values in the request. (not executed yet)  
- started mock service > now, executed Test request (without providing values in the request), now I found correct response (since it has been taking it from Mock Service)  
Note: Remember: You need to use MockService URL’s endpoint for execution.
